# Social-Sports-League
This project is a vehicle for me to learn how to use React and Redux in combination to handle views and state. It will start off fairly simply with teams, fixtures, results and a table. I will then go on to implement authorisation and then the ability to add/update teams and sports. I will also try and start using TTD before getting to far.

## Steps
* `git clone https://github.com/jon-atto-bennett/social-sports-league-react-redux.git`
* `cd social-sports-league-react-redux`
* `npm install`
* `npm run knex migrate:latest`
* `npm run knex seed:run`

 **To start the server, run `npm start`, and go to http://localhost:3000/**
